## OpenWeather API Integration

Nimbus uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. To use this app, you'll need to obtain an API key by signing up on the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/). Once you have the API key, create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following:

```.env
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key.
